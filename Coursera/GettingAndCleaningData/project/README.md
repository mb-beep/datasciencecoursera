# "Getting and Cleaning Data" project repo

This readme file explains how to use the following repo. 

## Intro
This repo basically consists of the data used, and the _run_analysis.R_ script for combining, cleaning and writing the data into a tidy data set _tidy_UCI_HAR_data.txt_. Further, the _CodeBook.md_ file explains which steps were taken to get to the final tidy data set _tidy_UCI_HAR_data.txt_.

## Credits
All the data found in either the .zip file (_prj.zip_) or the _UCI_HAR_Dataset_ folder has been collected by _Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio_ and _Luca Oneto_ at the _Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory_ in Genoa, Italy.

## Information on the data used
The data comes from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19 - 48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, _Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz et al._ captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
