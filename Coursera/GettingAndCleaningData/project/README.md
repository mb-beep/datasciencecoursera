# "Getting and Cleaning Data" project repo
This readme file explains how to use the following repo. 

## Intro
This repo basically consists of the data used, and the _run_analysis.R_ script for combining, cleaning and writing the data into a tidy data set _tidy_UCI_HAR_data.txt_. The cleaning steps, carried out by the _run_analysis.R_ script, are explained below.

## Credits
All the data found in either the .zip file (_prj.zip_) or the _UCI_HAR_Dataset_ folder has been collected by _Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio_ and _Luca Oneto_ at the _Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory_ in Genoa, Italy.
